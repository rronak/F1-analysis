# F1 Analysis

A comprehensive Formula 1 data analysis project exploring driver performance, lap times, and race statistics from the 2024-2025 season.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes Formula 1 racing data to uncover insights into driver performance, lap time distributions, and competitive dynamics. Using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, we explore patterns in race data to better understand what separates top performers in the world's premier racing series.

## 🏎️ Featured Analysis

### Lap Time Distribution Analysis
Comparative analysis of lap times between teammates, examining consistency and performance across all races. Example visualizations include box plots showing median lap times, quartile distributions, and outlier identification.
